Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used in Crypto/Forex Price Prediction, but it does not produce more accurate predictions due to overfitting, So we used Convolutional Neural Networks to reduce overfitting and get more accurate predictions.
Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging yet crucial task in financial markets due to the high volatility of digital assets. Traditional machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), have been widely used for forecasting financial time-series data. However, these models often face a critical problem: overfitting.
Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only meaningful patterns but also noise and random fluctuations in the training data, leading to poor generalization when tested on new data. This is a significant issue in financial forecasting because markets are unpredictable, and models must generalize well to be useful in real-world trading and investment scenarios.
To mitigate overfitting while maintaining the advantages of ANN in learning complex relationships, we introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the architecture. Although CNNs are primarily designed for image processing, they have proven effective in time-series forecasting by extracting important features while reducing unnecessary complexity.
